Design Prospective open cohort study. Participants Routinely collected data from 1436 general practices contributing data to QResearch in England between 2012 and 2016. 1079 practices were used to develop the scores and a separate set of 357 practices to validate the scores. 1.47 million patients aged 65-100 years were in the derivation cohort and 0.50 million patients in the validation cohort. Methods Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation cohort were used to derive separate risk equations in men and women for evaluation of the risk of death at one year. Risk factors considered were age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index, medical conditions, specific drugs, social factors, and results of recent investigations. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the validation cohort for men and women separately and for each age and ethnic group. The new mortality equation was used in conjunction with the existing QAdmissions equation (which predicts risk of unplanned hospital admission) to classify patients into frailty groups. Main outcome measure The primary outcome was all cause mortality. Results During follow-up 180 132 deaths were identified in the derivation cohort arising from 4.39 million person years of observation. The final model included terms for age, body mass index, Townsend score, ethnic group, smoking status, alcohol intake, unplanned hospital admissions in the past 12 months, atrial fibrillation, antipsychotics, cancer, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, living in a care home, congestive heart failure, corticosteroids, cardiovascular disease, dementia, epilepsy, learning disability, leg ulcer, chronic liver disease or pancreatitis, Parkinson’s disease, poor mobility, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, venous thromboembolism, anaemia, abnormal liver function test result, high platelet count, visited doctor in the past year with either appetite loss, unexpected weight loss, or breathlessness. The model had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, the equation explained 55.6% of the variation in time to death (R2), and had very good discrimination—the D statistic was 2.29, and Harrell’s C statistic value was 0.85. The corresponding values for men were 53.1%, 2.18, and 0.84. By combining predicted risks of mortality and unplanned hospital admissions, 2.7% of patients (n=13 665) were classified as severely frail, 9.4% (n=46 770) as moderately frail, 43.1% (n=215 253) as mildly frail, and 44.8% (n=223 790) as fit. Conclusions We have developed new equations to predict the short term risk of death in men and women aged 65 or more, taking account of demographic, social, and clinical variables. The equations had good performance on a separate validation cohort. The QMortality equations can be used in conjunction with the QAdmissions equations, to classify patients into four frailty groups (known as QFrailty categories) to enable patients to be identified for further assessment or interventions.","2017-09-20","2020-09-17 22:12:31","2020-09-17 22:12:31","2020-09-17 22:12:31","","","","358","","BMJ","Development and validation of QMortality risk prediction algorithm to estimate short term risk of death and assess frailty","","","","","","","en","Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences","","1758-535X","10.1093/gerona/glw166","","Background: Existing mortality prediction models for older adults have been each developed using a single study from the United States or Western Europe. We aimed to develop and validate a 10-year mortality prediction model for older adults using data from developed and developing countries. Methods: We used data from five cohorts, including data from 16 developed and developing countries: ELSA (English Longitudinal Study of Aging), HRS (Health and Retirement Study), MHAS (Mexican Health and Aging Study), SABE-Sao Paulo (The Health, Well-being and Aging), and SHARE (Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe). 35,367 older adults were split into training (two thirds) and test (one third) data sets. Baseline predictors included age, sex, comorbidities, and functional and cognitive measures. We performed an individual participant data meta-analysis using a sex-stratified Cox proportional hazards model, with time to death as the time scale. We validated the model using Harrell's C statistic (discrimination) and the estimated slope between observed and predicted 10-year mortality risk across deciles of risk (calibration). Results: During a median of 8.6 years, 8,325 participants died. The final model included age, sex, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, cancer, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, physical activity, self-reported health, difficulty with bathing, walking several blocks, and reporting date correctly. The model showed good discrimination (Harrell's C = 0.76) and calibration (slope = 1.005). Models for developed versus developing country cohorts performed equally well when applied to data from developing countries. Conclusion: A parsimonious mortality prediction model using data from multiple cohorts in developed and developing countries can be used to predict mortality in older adults in both settings.","2017","2020-09-17 22:16:00","2020-09-17 22:16:00","","410-416","","3","72","","J.

We quantified the association of a broad range of chronic diseases with physical health-related qualify of life and used these weights to develop and validate a multimorbidity weighted index (MWI). Community-dwelling adults in 3 national, prospective studies-the Nurses' Health Study (n = 121,701), Nurses' Health Study II (n = 116,686), and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (n = 51,529)-reported physician-diagnosed diseases and completed the Short Form 36 physical functioning (PF) scale over multiple survey cycles between 1992 and 2008. Mixed models were used to obtain regression coefficients for the impact of 98 morbid conditions on PF. The MWI was formed by weighting conditions by these coefficients and was validated through bootstrapping. The final sample included 612,592 observations from 216,890 participants (PF mean score = 46.5 (standard deviation, 11)). The association between diseases and PF varied severalfold (median, -1.4; range, -10.6 to 0.8). End-stage organ diseases were associated with the greatest reduction in PF. The mean MWI score was 4.8 (median, 3.7; range, 0-53), and the mean number of comorbid conditions was 3.3 (median, 2.8; range, 0-34). This validated MWI weights diseases by severity using PF, a patient-centered outcome. These results suggest that simple disease count is unlikely to capture the full impact of multimorbidity on health-related quality of life, and that the MWI is feasible and readily implemented.","2016","2020-09-17 22:16:48","2020-09-17 22:16:48","","357-365","","5","184","","Am.

Combining easily obtained measures into an accurate predictive model could be useful to clinicians advising patients, as well as policy makers and epidemiologists interested in risk adjustment. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a prognostic index for 4-year mortality using information that can be obtained from patient report. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using the 1998 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a population-based study of community-dwelling US adults older than 50 years, we developed the prognostic index from 11,701 individuals and validated the index with 8009. Individuals were asked about their demographic characteristics, whether they had specific diseases, and whether they had difficulty with a series of functional measures. We identified variables independently associated with mortality and weighted the variables to create a risk index. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death by December 31, 2002. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 81%. During the 4-year follow-up, there were 1361 deaths (12%) in the development cohort and 1072 deaths (13%) in the validation cohort. Twelve independent predictors of mortality were identified: 2 demographic variables (age: 60-64 years, 1 point; 65-69 years, 2 points; 70-74 years, 3 points; 75-79 years, 4 points; 80-84 years, 5 points, >85 years, 7 points and male sex, 2 points), 6 comorbid conditions (diabetes, 1 point; cancer, 2 points; lung disease, 2 points; heart failure, 2 points; current tobacco use, 2 points; and body mass index <25, 1 point), and difficulty with 4 functional variables (bathing, 2 points; walking several blocks, 2 points; managing money, 2 points, and pushing large objects, 1 point. Scores on the risk index were strongly associated with 4-year mortality in the validation cohort, with 0 to 5 points predicting a less than 4% risk, 6 to 9 points predicting a 15% risk, 10 to 13 points predicting a 42% risk, and 14 or more points predicting a 64% risk. The risk index showed excellent discrimination with a cstatistic of 0.84 in the development cohort and 0.82 in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: This prognostic index, incorporating age, sex, self-reported comorbid conditions, and functional measures, accurately stratifies community-dwelling older adults into groups at varying risk of mortality.","2006-02-15","2020-09-17 22:18:25","2020-09-17 22:18:25","","801-808","","7","295","","JAMA","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 16478903","","/home/terminological/Zotero/storage/PMWENN6L/Lee et al. - 2006 - Development and validation of a prognostic index f.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16478903","","Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Mortality; Risk Assessment; Prognosis; Logistic Models; Health Status Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research focused on mortality risk (e.g. 28% at 4 years) which is more difficult to interpret than LE (e.g. 7.3 years) for both patients and clinicians. Our objective was to utilize the Gompertz Law of Human Mortality which states that mortality risk doubles in a fixed time interval to transform the Lee mortality index into a LE calculator. METHODS: We examined community-dwelling older adults age 50 and over enrolled in the nationally representative 1998 wave of the Health and Retirement Study or HRS (response rate 81%), dividing study respondents into development (n = 11701) and validation (n = 8009) cohorts. In the development cohort, we fit proportional hazards Gompertz survival functions for each of the risk groups defined by the Lee mortality index. We validated our LE estimates by comparing our predicted LE with observed survival in the HRS validation cohort and an external validation cohort from the 2004 wave of the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing or ELSA (n = 7042). RESULTS: The ELSA cohort had a lower 8-year mortality risk (14%) compared to our HRS development (23%) and validation cohorts (25%). Our model had good discrimination in the validation cohorts (Harrell's c 0.78 in HRS and 0.80 in the ELSA). Our predicted LE's were similar to observed survival in the HRS validation cohort without evidence of miscalibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow, p = 0.2 at 8 years). However, our predicted LE's were longer than observed survival in the ELSA cohort with evidence of miscalibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow, p<0.001 at 8 years) reflecting the lower mortality rate in ELSA. CONCLUSION: We transformed a previously validated mortality index into a LE calculator that incorporated patient-level risk factors. Our LE calculator may help clinicians determine which preventive interventions are most appropriate for older US adults.","2014","2020-09-17 22:19:19","2020-09-17 22:19:19","","e108540","","9","9","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25265291 PMCID: PMC4180452","","/home/terminological/Zotero/storage/GWI5WYQY/Lee et al. - 2014 - Individualizing life expectancy estimates for olde.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25265291","","Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Aged, 80 and over; Proportional Hazards Models; Mortality; Life Expectancy; Age Factors; Aging; Longitudinal Studies; Longevity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN: A comparison of the performance of the index in predicting mortality among new respondents to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS, 2001-2004) with that of respondents from the original development and validation cohorts (1997-2000) and a test of its performance over extended follow-up (up to 9 years) using the original cohorts. Follow-up mortality data were available through 2006. SETTING: NHIS. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two thousand fifty-seven new respondents to the NHIS (2001-2004) and 24,139 respondents from the original development and validation cohorts (1997-2000). MEASUREMENTS: A risk score was calculated for each respondent based on the presence or absence of 11 factors (function, illnesses, behaviors, demographics) that make up the index. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, 5-year mortality estimates were computed for the new and original cohort respondents and 9-year mortality estimates for the original cohorts. RESULTS: New respondents were similar to original cohort respondents but were slightly more likely to be aged 85 and older, report diabetes mellitus, and have a body mass index of 25.0 kg/m² or greater. The model performed as well in the new cohort as it had in the original cohort. New respondents with risk scores of 0 to 1 had a 2% risk of 5-year mortality, whereas respondents who scored 18 or higher had a 69% risk of 5-year mortality (range 3-71% risk of 5-year mortality in the development cohort). The index also demonstrated excellent calibration and discrimination in predicting 9-year mortality (range 7% risk for scores of 0-1 to 92% risk for scores of ≥ 18, original validation cohort extended).
